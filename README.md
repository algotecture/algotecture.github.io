[AlgoTecture](https://algotecture.net/ "AlgoTecture's Homepage") radically simplifies collaborative design, construction and operation processes by providing an intelligent framework.

We present here an AlgoTecture's [sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)/) which demystifies the technologies we use to make the world as a safer and better place via sharing of an open-source content of the tech-stack. 

If you have any comments about our WEB presence, you can write us at the address post(dot)ddemin(at)gmail(dot)com â€” however, due to the limited number of members, we are unable to provide a direct response.
